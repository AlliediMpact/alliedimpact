## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```bash
Node.js >= 18
pnpm >= 8.0
Firebase CLI
```

### Installation
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repo-url>
cd alliedimpact

# Install all dependencies (monorepo)
pnpm install

# Copy environment templates for each app
cp apps/coinbox/.env.example apps/coinbox/.env.local
cp apps/careerbox/.env.example apps/careerbox/.env.local
cp web/portal/.env.example web/portal/.env.local
# ... repeat for all apps

# Configure Firebase credentials in each .env.local file
```

### Running Apps Locally

#### Portal (Main Dashboard)
```bash
cd web/portal
pnpm dev
# Opens on http://localhost:3005
```

#### Individual Apps
```bash
# CoinBox (P2P Finance)
cd apps/coinbox
pnpm dev
# http://localhost:3000

# CareerBox (Job Matching)
cd apps/careerbox
pnpm dev
# http://localhost:3003

# DriveMaster (Driver Training)
cd apps/drivemaster
pnpm dev
# http://localhost:3001

# EduTech (Educational Courses)
cd apps/edutech
pnpm dev
# http://localhost:3007

# SportsHub (Sports Predictions)
cd apps/sports-hub
pnpm dev
# http://localhost:3008

# ControlHub (Internal Monitoring)
cd apps/controlhub
pnpm dev
# http://localhost:3010
```

#### Run Multiple Apps Simultaneously
```bash
# From monorepo root using Turborepo
pnpm dev --filter=@allied-impact/portal
pnpm dev --filter=@allied-impact/coinbox
pnpm dev --filter=@allied-impact/careerbox
```

### Firebase Emulators (Local Development)
```bash
# Start Firebase emulators (Auth, Firestore)
firebase emulators:start

# Emulators run on:
# - Auth: http://localhost:9099
# - Firestore: http://localhost:8080
# - Functions: http://localhost:5001
```

---

## 🔐 Authentication & Single Sign-On

### How Users Access the Platform

#### Option A: Via Main Portal
```
1. User visits alliedimpact.co.za
2. Logs in once (Firebase Auth)
3. Lands on unified dashboard
4. Sees all apps they have entitlements to
5. Clicks app card → navigates to app with SSO
```

#### Option B: Direct App Access
```
1. User visits coinbox.alliedimpact.co.za directly
2. Logs in with same Firebase credentials
3. App verifies entitlements
4. Enters app (can navigate back to dashboard)
```

### Key Security Principles
- **One Account, All Apps**: Single Firebase identity across the ecosystem
- **Entitlement-Based Access**: Apps verify permissions before granting access
- **Isolated Databases**: Each app has its own Firestore collections
- **No Cross-App Data Sharing**: Apps cannot access each other's data
- **Defensive Security Rules**: Firestore rules prevent unauthorized access

```

### Deployment Process (Per App)
```bash
# Deploy to Vercel
cd apps/coinbox
vercel --prod

# Deploy Firestore security rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules --project coinbox-ddc10

## 🧠 Architecture Principles

### Platform Layer (`platform/`)
**Responsibilities**:
- User authentication (Firebase wrapper)
- Subscription & billing management
- Entitlement verification
- Cross-app notifications
- Shared types and utilities

**Does NOT**:
- Contain app-specific business logic
- Access app databases directly
- Make app-level decisions

### App Layer (`apps/`)
**Responsibilities**:
- App-specific business logic
- App-specific database schemas (Firestore collections)
- App-specific UI/UX
- App-specific workflows

**Does NOT**:
- Duplicate authentication systems
- Bypass platform entitlements
- Share databases with other apps

### Key Principle: **Separation of Concerns**
```
Platform = Identity + Access Control + Shared Services
Apps = Business Logic + Data + UI
Firebase = Auth Provider + Real-time DB + Storage
```

---

## 🤝 Contributing

### Development Workflow
1. **Read Documentation**: All platform docs + specific app README
2. **Create Feature Branch**: `feature/app-name-description`
3. **Follow Patterns**: Reference CoinBox as gold standard (385+ tests)
4. **Write Tests**: Unit tests for business logic required
5. **Open Pull Request**: Detailed description, link to issue
6. **Code Review**: Minimum 1 approval required
7. **Merge & Deploy**: Auto-deploy to staging

### Code Quality Standards
- **TypeScript**: 100% type coverage, no `any` types
- **Testing**: Unit tests for critical paths, E2E for user flows
- **Security**: Firestore rules for all collections, entitlement checks
- **Documentation**: Inline comments, README per app
- **Git Commits**: Semantic commit messages

### ✅ DO:
- Reuse platform services (`@allied-impact/auth`, `@allied-impact/entitlements`, `@allied-impact/billing`)
- Check entitlements before granting app access
- Write comprehensive tests (reference CoinBox's 385+ tests)
- Document architectural decisions
- Follow existing UI patterns (Tailwind + shadcn/ui)

### ❌ DON'T:
- Rewrite production apps (CoinBox, MyProjects, CareerBox, etc.)
- Create new authentication systems per app
- Duplicate entitlement logic
- Share databases between apps
- Bypass security rules
- Add features without user validation

---
