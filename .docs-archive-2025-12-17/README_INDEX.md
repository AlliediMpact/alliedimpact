## 🎯 Key Concepts Explained

### Multi-Product Platform
Instead of building separate apps, we build ONE platform that hosts multiple products. Users log in once and can access all products they're entitled to.

**Analogy**: Think of Google (Gmail, Drive, Calendar) or Microsoft (Word, Excel, Teams) - one account, multiple products.

### Product Entitlement
A system that controls which products a user can access. Like having a "membership card" for each product.

**Example**:
```json
{
  "coinbox": { "active": true },      // User CAN access
  "drivemaster": { "active": false }, // User CANNOT access
  "codetech": { "active": true }      // User CAN access
}
```

### Hybrid Database Approach
Using TWO database systems:
- **Cosmos DB** for platform-wide data (users, entitlements, billing)
- **Firebase** for product-specific data (wallets, loans, lessons)

**Why?** Best of both worlds - Cosmos DB scales globally, Firebase is proven for Coin Box.

### Monorepo
One Git repository containing all products. Makes it easier to share code and deploy together.

**Structure**:
```
/allied-impact
├── /platform        (shared)
├── /apps
│   ├── /coinbox     (product 1)
│   ├── /drive-master (product 2)
│   └── ...
```

### Phased Rollout
Implementing changes gradually rather than all at once.

**Example**:
- Phase 1: Platform foundation (safe, no user impact)
- Phase 2: Integrate Coin Box (test with 1% of users first)
- Phase 3: Add Drive Master (new product, no risk to Coin Box)
- etc.
